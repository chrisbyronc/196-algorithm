# 196 Algorithm experiments 

196 is the lowest number lychrel number

## About the script

To better understand the 196 algorithm and lychrel numbers, this python script demonstrates the highest number of iterations to reach
a palindrome in a range of any two given numbers. This first number that never reaches a palindrome is 196, the second being 295.
